# BIOMES #

# Here is the list of the current biomes you can add into your world, this list may change with further updates :
# - Autumn
# - Canyon

# - FlowerMountain
# - Ice
# - Island
# - Japanese
# - Jungle
# - Mountain
# - MushroomForest

# - Oasis
# - Plain

# centerX and centerY features are here for people who want high customization of biomes placement (Customization will be explained later).
# tree_probability is the probability to place a tree per chunk (value between 0 and 1)
# However if you use the presets already made in this plugin, you don't need to tune them. Simply be sure theses arguments are always between 0 and 1
# You can add as many biomes as you want, even multiple sames biomes
